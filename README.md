[![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/f5networks/terraform-azure-bigip-module.svg)](https://github.com/f5networks/terraform-azure-bigip-module/issues)

## Prerequisites

This module is supported from Terraform 0.13 version onwards.

Below templates are tested and worked in the following version

Terraform v0.14.0

+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/azurerm v2.28.0
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/null v2.1.2
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/random v2.3.0
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/template v2.1.2

!> **Note:** bigip-module v1.2.0 Requires azurerm > 3.0 version

## Releases and Versioning

This module is supported in the following bigip and terraform version

| BIGIP version | Terraform 1.X  | Terraform 0.14 |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| BIG-IP 17.x   |       X        |      X         |
| BIG-IP 16.x   |       X        |      X         |
| BIG-IP 15.x   |       X        |      X         |

## Password Management

|:point_up: |By default bigip module will have random password setting to give dynamic password generation|
|----|---|

|:point_up: |Users Can explicitly provide password as input to Module using optional Variable "f5_password"|
|----|---|

|:point_up:  | To use Azure key vault  password,we have to enable the variable "az_keyvault_authentication" to true and supply the variables with key_valut name,secret along with resource group name where azure key vault is defined|
|-----|----|

## Depreciations

+ zones variable in `azurerm_public_ip` resource is depreciated to new variable `availability_zones`. Hence we need to have new input variable for our module zone assignment in public_ip resource and below is the new variable for it. We have updated our examples according to it.
  
  ```hcl
  variable availabilityZones_public_ip {
      description = "The availability zone to allocate the Public IP in. Possible values are Zone-Redundant, 1, 2, 3, and No-Zone."
      type        = string
      default     = "Zone-Redundant"
  }
  ```

## BYOL Licensing

This template uses PayGo BIG-IP image for the deployment (as default). If you would like to use BYOL licenses, then these following steps are needed:

+ Find available images/versions with *BYOL* in SKU name using Azure CLI:

    ```sh
    > az vm image list -f BIG-IP --all

            # example output...

            {
              "offer": "f5-big-ip-byol",
              "publisher": "f5-networks",
              "sku": "f5-big-ltm-2slot-byol",
              "urn": "f5-networks:f5-big-ip-byol:f5-big-ltm-2slot-byol:15.1.201000",
              "version": "15.1.201000"
            },
    ```

+ In the `variables.tf`, modify `image_name` and `product_name` with the SKU and offer from AZ CLI results

    ```hcl
            # BIGIP Image
            variable product_name { default = "f5-big-ip-byol" }
            variable image_name { default = "f5-big-ltm-2slot-byol" }
    ```

+ Add the corresponding license key in DO declaration( Declarative Onboarding ), this DO can be added in custom run-time-int script ( as given in examples section ) or POST a Declarative Onboarding declaration as given in url.
(<https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-declarative-onboarding/latest/bigip-examples.html#standalone-declaration> )

    ```shell
          "myLicense": {
          "class": "License",
          "licenseType": "regKey",
          "regKey": "${regKey}"
      },
    ```

## Custom User data

+ By default `custom_user_data` will be `null` , bigip module will use default `f5_onboard.tmpl` file contents for initial BIGIP onboard connfiguration

+ If users desire custom onboard configuration,we can use this variable and pass contents of custom script to the variable to have custom onboard bigip  configuration.( An example is provided in examples section )

### Example 3-NIC Deployment Module usage with `custom_user_data`

```hcl
module bigip {
  source                      = "F5Networks/bigip-module/azure"
  prefix                      = "bigip-azure-3nic"
  resource_group_name         = "testbigip"
  mgmt_subnet_ids             = [{"subnet_id" = "subnet_id_mgmt" , "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" =  ""}]
  mgmt_securitygroup_ids      = ["securitygroup_id_mgmt"]
  external_subnet_ids         = [{"subnet_id" =  "subnet_id_external", "public_ip" = true, "private_ip_primary" = "", "private_ip_secondary" = "" }]
  external_securitygroup_ids  = ["securitygroup_id_external"]
  internal_subnet_ids         = [{"subnet_id" =  "subnet_id_internal", "public_ip"=false, "private_ip_primary" = "" }]
  internal_securitygroup_ids  = ["securitygropu_id_internal"]
  availabilityZones           =  var.availabilityZones
  availabilityZones_public_ip = var.availabilityZones_public_ip
  custom_user_data            = var.custom_user_data
}
```

## Example Usage

+ We have provided some common deployment [examples](https://github.com/F5Networks/terraform-azure-bigip-module/tree/main/examples)

!> **Note:** There should be one to one mapping between subnet_ids and securitygroup_ids (for example if we have 2 or more external subnet_ids,we have to give same number of external securitygroup_ids to module)

!> **Note:** Users can have dynamic or static private ip allocation.If primary/secondary private ip value is null it will be dynamic,else it will be static private ip allocation.

!> **Note:** With Static private ip allocation we can assign primary and secondary private ips for external interfaces, whereas primary private ip for management and internal interfaces.

~> **WARNING** If it is static private ip allocation we can't use module count,as same private ips will be tried to allocate for multiple bigip instances based on module count.

~> **WARNING** With Dynamic private ip allocation,we have to pass null value to primary/secondary private ip declaration and module count will be supported.

!> **Note:** Sometimes it is observed that the given static primary and secondary private ips may get exchanged. This is the limitation present in aws.

~>**NOTE:** This Module uses basic [DO](https://github.com/F5Networks/terraform-azure-bigip-module/blob/main/config/onboard_do.json) config to set the Users and Passwords as part of runtime-init, it does not config VLANS/SelfIPs and other configuration.

~>**NOTE:** If you are using custom ATC tools, don't change name of ATC tools rpm file( ex: f5-declarative-onboarding-xxxx.noarch.rpm,f5-appsvcs-xxx.noarch.rpm)

### Below example snippets show how this module is called. ( Dynamic private ip allocation )

  availabilityZones           = var.availabilityZones
  availabilityZones_public_ip = var.availabilityZones_public_ip
}
```

+ Similarly we can have N-nic deployments based on user provided subnet_ids and securitygroup_ids.

+ With module count, user can deploy multiple bigip instances in the azure cloud (with the default value of count being one)

      description = "List of BIG-IP private addresses"
      value       = flatten([for i in range(length(module.bigip.*.private_addresses)) : module.bigip.*.private_addresses[i]["public_private"]["private_ip"]])
    }
  ```

~>**NOTE:** A local json file will get generated which contains the DO declaration (for 1,2,3 nics as provided in the examples )

#### BIG-IP Automation Toolchain InSpec Profile for testing readiness of Automation Tool Chain components

After the module deployment, we can use inspec tool for verifying the Bigip connectivity along with ATC components

This InSpec profile evaluates the following:

+ Basic connectivity to a BIG-IP management endpoint ('bigip-connectivity')
+ Availability of the Declarative Onboarding (DO) service ('bigip-declarative-onboarding')
+ Version reported by the Declarative Onboarding (DO) service ('bigip-declarative-onboarding-version')
+ Availability of the Application Services (AS3) service ('bigip-application-services')
+ Version reported by the Application Services (AS3) service ('bigip-application-services-version')
+ Availability of the Telemetry Streaming (TS) service ('bigip-telemetry-streaming')
+ Version reported by the Telemetry Streaming (TS) service ('bigip-telemetry-streaming-version')
+ Availability of the Cloud Failover Extension( CFE ) service ('bigip-cloud-failover-extension')
+ Version reported by the Cloud Failover Extension( CFE ) service('bigip-cloud-failover-extension-version')

#### run inspec tests

we can either run inspec exec command or execute runtests.sh in any one of example nic folder which will run below inspec command

```bash
inspec exec inspec/bigip-ready  --input bigip_address=$BIGIP_MGMT_IP bigip_port=$BIGIP_MGMT_PORT user=$BIGIP_USER password=$BIGIP_PASSWORD do_version=$DO_VERSION as3_version=$AS3_VERSION ts_version=$TS_VERSION fast_version=$FAST_VERSION cfe_version=$CFE_VERSION
```
